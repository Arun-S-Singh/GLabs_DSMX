## SESSION PLAN

### Session Name - Python: Handling Program Flow 

**Learning Outcomes** 

- Work with conditional statements and loops like if-else, for, while
- Read and write to a file with Python
- Handle errors and exceptions in Python
- Create and work with functions
- Programming with the Object-Oriented Paradigm

**Prerequisites for the Student**

- Python: Handling Program Flow  - Go through the concept and solve the tasks and assessments.

**Student Activities**

- Discuss with the Mentor what you have learned.
- Overview of Handling Program flow in python
  - Control Statements and Loops
  - What are the functions?
  - Object-Oriented Programming
  - Exceptions and File I/O
  - Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50.
        Note: The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....              
        Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
  - What are the benefits and limitations of using python?

- Code Walkthrough (refer the GitHub repo [Code Walkthrough](https://github.com/commit-live-students/GLabs_DSMX/tree/master/Sprint%201%20Python%20Fundamentals/1.2_%20Python_%20Handling%20Program%20Flow/Code%20Walkthrough))
- Questions and Discussion on doubts - AMA

- Team Activity - It is ok to be wrong and the whole point of the activity is to make you think. You will have to fill a google form as part of the activity with your answers. (Refer the GitHub repo to see the [Activity](https://github.com/commit-live-students/GLabs_DSMX/blob/master/Sprint%201%20Python%20Fundamentals/1.2_%20Python_%20Handling%20Program%20Flow/Activity/Activity%20-%20Identifying%20the%20Correct%20Flow.md))


**Next Session** 

- Concept - Manipulating Data with Numpy

- Key topics to be highlighted - highlight where they would need to spend more time and importance w.r.t Data Science.
  - Arrays in NumPy
  - Creating NumPy arrays
  - Indexing and Slicing NumPy arrays
  - Applying NumPy hands-on
