# Welcome to GreyAtom !

This is the GreyAtom repository for the Data Science Masters Program. In here you'll find the course curriculum comprising of Sprints. 

Every Sprint has two concepts and inside every concept, you'll find the session content for the session reserved for that particular concept. This session content consists of :

- **Sesssion Plan** :   A outline of the activities and content to be covered in the session.
- **Code Walkthrough** :  This folder contains an IPython notebook and the data file for the code-walkthrough to be performed during the session.
